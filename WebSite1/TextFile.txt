Project Description:

This webpage is designed to allow you to enter any text that you wish to encrypt 
and results in an encoded sentence. This page also acts in the converse way, by 
entering an encoded sentence,you can decrypt it and view the plain text.



Technoliogies used: 

this site utilises:
ASP.NET
C#
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap




What I Learned:

I started this course a blank canvas, having rarely coded in my life. Only 5-8  weeks
later and i can create pages or this quality and useability. Imagine how much I can grow 
with more time


Future scope:

This program could be improved by adding extra encrypting algorithms. This allows 
for more choices as well as more complex cyphers to encrypt text. Can also be utilised
validating and securing data across the internet, making certain data more secure.


// Process:
//
// A B C D E F G H I J K L M
// N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
//
//#    Take user input text, convert to char and set all to lower case;
//##   Use an if statement, if the char is A-M then + 13 ; and is N-Z then -13;
//###  Catch the results back into an array then iterate them back into a text window.
//
//#### Decrypting works the opposite way,
